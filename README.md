The purpose of this project is to quickly create a portfolio which will have a better design, look and feel to it to help it come across more attractive to recuiters. Due to the fact I have need to get this project out as soon as possible while I am creating my 3D portfolio, I will be using some starter code provided by adrianhajdin.

# Libraries and dependencies used:

ReactJS / react-dom / react-icons(!!Ilike this!!) / 
NextJS
styled-components  - This should help simply styles throughout the project.
styled-normailse

# Learned along the way:

* Make sure that all dependencies are up to date before 'npm run dev'. Early on in the project I came across an error when trying to run dev as the package.json file was from provided starter code so when I 'npm i' at the start, it didn't install the latest version of react which in then turn had errors running NextJS. Fix: before running npm run dev, you can upgrade the version on React with 'npm install react@^18.2.0 react-dom@^18.2.0' or a later version in the future.

*I have had add 'legacyBehavior' to get the <Link> to show as<Link legacyBehavior><a><a></Link> working correctly with a tag inbetween Link.
